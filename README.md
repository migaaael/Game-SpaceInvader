# Game-SpaceInvader
This is my first mini-project using Python. I have recently (April 2023) finished my Python course and I am now applying what I've learned into mini-projects. I would like to make a note that I do now I could've used classes and object-oriented programming in this game, but I'm still taking my first steps.

For this project I wll be only sharing the code and the .exe file available for download in the following link:
